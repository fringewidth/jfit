# jFit
jFit is a Java utility that automates the generation of Python code for empirical complexity analysis by producing plots of time against input size (n) using Matplotlib, and fitting an appropriate curve


## Prerequisites
- jFit requires Java to execute successfully
- To run the Python code generated by the script, the following packages are needed:
    ```sh
    pip install scipy
    pip install numpy
    pip install matplotlib
    ```

## Installation
- Clone the git repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/fringewidth/jfit.git
    ```
- Open the package in a Java IDE of your choice(e.g VSCode)
    ```sh
    code jfit/jFit
    ```

## Usage
- Replace the body of ```public static void method(long[] array, long n)``` with the body of the java method of your choice, where ```array[]``` is the array to be manipulated, and ```n``` is the length of the array.

- **Important** jFit currently supports the analysis of algorithms that operate on a single array only.

- Change the parameters of ```ComplexityAnalyzer.generateMatPlotLib()``` in the ```main``` method.
    - ```startRange```: Starting range of input size(n)
    - ```endRange```: Ending range (non-inclusive) of size(n)
    - ```incrementValue```: Step value of input size(n)
    - ```efficiencyClass```: The efficiency class of the method. jFit plots emprical data of the running time for the given range of values n, and fits a curve accordingly.

- The following efficiency classes are currently avaliable:
    - ```EFFICIENCY_CLASS.CONSTANT``` for $O(1)$ complexities
    - ```EFFICIENCY_CLASS.POLYNOMIAL``` for $O(n^2)$ complexities
    - ```EFFICIENCY_CLASS.LINEARITHMIC``` for $O(n\log n)$ complexities
    - ```EFFICIENCY_CLASS.EXPONENTIAL``` for $O(2^n)$ complexities
    - ```EFFICIENCY_CLASS.FACTORIAL``` for $O(n!)$ complexities

- Support for $O(n^k)$ is planned

- Run ```fit.py```
